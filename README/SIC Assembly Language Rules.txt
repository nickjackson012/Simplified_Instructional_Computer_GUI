SIC ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE RULES
===========================

COLUMN RULES Page 52
=================================================
Four white space delimited columns in this order:
LABEL, OPCODE, OPERAND, REMARKS
All Columns are right justified


INPUT RULES Page 455
===============================================================================
1) The LABEL on a SOURCE PROGRAM statement, if present, must begin in column 1 
of the statement.  The OPCODE field is separated from LABEL field bay at least
one blank; if no LABEL is present, the OPCODE may begin anywhere after column 1

2) LABELS may be from 1 to 6 characters in length.  The first character must be
alphabetic (A-Z); each of the remaining characters may be alphabetic or numeric 
(A-Z) or (0-9)

3) The OPCODE field must contain one of the SIC mnemonic opcodes, or one of the 
ASSEMBLE DIRECTIVE: BYTE, WORD, RESB, RESW, START, END

4) An OPERAND may be either a SYMBOL (which appears as a LABEL in the program) 
or a HEXIDECIMAL number that represents an actual machine address.  HEXIDECIMAL
numbers used in this way must begin with a leading zero (to distinguish them
from SYMBOLS) and must be between 0000 and 0FFFF in value

5) A HEXIDECIMAL string OPERAND in a BYTE directive must be of the form
X'hhh...', where each h is a character representing a HEXIDECIMAL digit (0-9 or
A-F).  There must be an even number of such HEXIDECIMAL digits.  The maximum
length of the string is 32 HEX digits (representing 16 bytes in memory)

6)The SOURCE PROGRAM may contain as many as 500 distinct LABELS


OUTPUT RULES Page 455
==================================================================================
1) The ASSEMBLY LISTING should show each source program statement (including 
any comments), together with the current LOCATION COUNTER value, the OBJECT CODE
generated, and any ERROR MESSAGES

2) The OBJECT PROGRAM should occupy no address greater than HEXIDECIMAL FFFF

3) The OBJECT PROGRAM should not be generated if any ASSEMBLY ERRORS are detected





INFERRED RULES Page 45
==================================================================================
1) Line Length = 95 characters max
2) Commented lines are indicated when the first character encountered is a period (.)
2a) Blank lines are not allowed
2b) All code must be in capital letters (not enforced in REMARKS)
3) Column based.  Four Columns: LABEL, OPCODE, OPERANDS, REMARKS

4) LABEL
4a) LABEL is optional, must start in first column if present
4b) First character must be alphabetic (A-Z)
4c) All other characters can be alphabetic or numeric (A-Z or 0-9)
4d) Max LABEL Size = 6 characters
4e) Min LABEL Size = 1 character
4f) Column Width = 10 characters
4g) Column Count = 1-10 (1-based index)
4h) Column Count = 0-9 ( 0-based index)

5) OPCODE
5a) Must be an OPCODE mnemonic or an ASSEMBLER DIRECTIVE 
5b) START must be the first opcode encountered
5c) Max OPCODE Size = 5 characters
5d) Min OPCODE Size = 1 character
5e) Column Width = 9 characters
5f) Column Count = 11-19 (1-based index)
5g) Column Count = 10-18 ( 0-based index)
5h) Assembly processing stops after END is encountered

6) OPERAND 
6a) OPERAND will not be present with OPCODE RSUB
6b) An OPERAND may be either a SYMBOL (which appears as a LABEL in the program) 
or a HEXIDECIMAL number that represents an actual machine address.  HEXIDECIMAL
numbers used in this way must begin with a leading zero (to distinguish them
from SYMBOLS) and must be between 0000 and 0FFFF in value 
6c) A HEXIDECIMAL string OPERAND in a BYTE directive must be of the form X'HEX VALUE(0-9, A-F)' or C'ASCII CHARS'
HEX VALUES must an even number of such HEXIDECIMAL digits.  The maximum length of the string is 32 HEX digits 
(35 characters total, representing 16 bytes in memory).  EXAMPLE:  X'HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH'
ASCII CHARACTERS can have a maximum of 32 characters (C'1-32 ASCII CHARS')
6d) Indexed Addressing is indicated by adding the modifier ",X" following
the OPERAND.  EXAMPLE:
			LDCH		BUFFER,X
IE: Memory address of BUFFER plus value in the X register.  
This is a way to address an indexed list of bytes or words
6e) OPERANDS can be marked up with C'ccc' for Character or X'hhh...' for 
HEXIDECIMAL number, and can be a DECIMAL value if not otherwise marked up
6f) Max OPERAND Size = 35 characters (LABEL, HEXIDECIMAL, DECIMAL, or Character)
6g) Min OPERAND Size = 1 character
6h) Column Width = 36 characters
6i) Column Count = 20-55 (1-based index)
6j) Column Count = 19-54 ( 0-based index)

7) REMARKS 
7a) REMARKS are optional
7b) Free Text
7c) Max Remark Size = 30 characters
7d) Min Remark Size = 0 characters
7e) Column Width = 30 characters
7f) Column Count = 66-95 (1-based index)
7g) Column Count = 65-94 ( 0-based index)



ASSEMBLY LISTING FILE RULES
===========================

COLUMN RULES Page 47
=================================================
Five white space delimited columns in this order:
LOC, LABEL, OPCODE, OPERAND, OBJECT CODE
All Columns are right justified

COLUMN WIDTHS Page 47
=====================
LOC			9 characters
LABEL		10 characters 
OPCODE		9 characters
OPERAND 	36 characters
OBJECT CODE	36 characters

COLUMN FORMAT Page 47
=====================
LOC			Valid 4-digit hex memory address (0000-7FFF)
OBJECT CODE Typically a 6-digit hex value representing a
			2-digit OPCODE and a 4-digit MEMORY ADDRESS.
			With BYTE this column can contain up to 32 characters.
			With WORD it will contain a 6-digit hex value corresponding 
			to the specified dec integer value.
			With START, END, RESW and RESB this column will have no entry
