PROGRAMMING GUIDELINES
======================
1) We will not correct assembly code or assembly coding errors
2) All assembly code must be in capital letters - not enforced in REMARKS
3) Assembly code parsing stops when the END opcode is encountered.  
   The END operand is not used and will not be processed.  Instead it will be discarded
4) We will pad hex memory addresses with leading zeros
5) Name errors after the modules that raise them.  EX: SICMODULENAMEError
6) It's ok to do some validation checks in the converter modules
7) Create a CONSTANTS module.  Alphabetize CONSTANTS in this module
8) Handle positive case first with IF-ELIF-ELSE statements
